This tool pops a notification on these conditions:
- The system is plugged in
- The battery is exceeding 80%

I am so tired of vendors not having or making only half-decent, bloatware-filled apps for just a simple job of monitoring the charging process. By only charging up to 80%, the battery longevity can be vastly prolonged. Not everyone goes to long trips and need absolute 100% of their battery available to them. I alternate between short trips from home and work where I could recharge easily. I prefer to have my battery replaced less time in a year than just a tad longer battery life everyday.
